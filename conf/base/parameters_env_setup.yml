  # Minigrid env configs are adapted from DEIR project
  minigrid_env_params:
    observation: "full" # full | partial, whether the agent have full access to the environment grid or only partial access, by default we use full access because this work we do not focus on exploration
    auxiliary_info: ["grid"] # grid allows the agent possesses an inherent capability to map pixels to their corresponding objects, which allows for creating oracle reward machines. Reward machine construction and learning are not the focus of this work.

  montezuma_env_params:
    level_name: "MontezumaRevengeNoFrameskip-v4"
    # the montezuma env will have separated training data collection script 
    # thus montezuma env will only influence the 
    # 1. setup_env, 2. train_validate_test_split_node, 3. setup_balance_dataloader. It will not affect a) expert_policy_setup and b) generate_traj_instr_pairs_node
